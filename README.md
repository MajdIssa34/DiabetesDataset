We will be looking at a diabetes dataset, which have multiple health features such as pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels and more, and an outcome which is labeled either 0 or 1, 0 being non-diabetic, and 1 having diabetes. We will explore the dataset, looking for null values, outliers, as well as creating 6 different models to predict the outcome of the diabetes dataset. Which are the following:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

And at the end comparing all the different values of their testing and training scores by plotting them in a bar plot.
